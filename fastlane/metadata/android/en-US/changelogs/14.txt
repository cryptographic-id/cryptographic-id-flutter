The Prime256v1 fingerprint was calculated from the complete public-key binary data. This is incorrect, since there are multiple ways to encode a public-key. The new fingerprint will be calculated only from the decoded raw points on the curve.
There are now too fields for the fingerprint:
- one with the old calculation for backwards-compatitility, which will be removed in the future.
- one with the new calculation
