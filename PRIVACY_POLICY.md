# Privacy Policy for Cryptographic ID

_Last updated: 2023-05-17_

This app respects the privacy of its users.
We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, to be subject to, and to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the application after the date such a revised Privacy Policy is posted.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online or mobile store from which you install the application, which may also collect and use data about you. We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.

## Collection of your information

This app has no permission to access the internet, so no data is sent to a server, and we cannot use your data since we don't have it. The only data leaving your device is the data you share via QR code. You are responsible for deciding what data you share via QR code and with whom.

### Permissions

This app may request permission to access certain features on your mobile device, including your mobile device's camera and sensors. If you wish to change the permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.
